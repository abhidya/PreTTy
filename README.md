**Inception** :

A group project for COSC 340 - Software Engineering. A visual File Browser that will size icons by usage. Members include : Cody, Cara, Manny, Nathan, and Hayden. The construction phase will last 5 sprints with intermittent demos to Dr.Hunley.

**Elaboration:**

- Detailed requirements
  - Supports Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems
  - Saves file usage counts
  - Pulls Icons through OS for files
  - Sizes Icons based on usage (large for more frequently used)
  - Different Visual Layouts
  - Use Cases???
  - Risks:
    - ■■Requirements risks:
      - Supporting different OS&#39;s may bring unforeseeable challenges.
    - ■■Technological Risks:
      - Memory usage for saving file counts
      - Resizing GUI with icons
    - ■■Skills Risks:
      - GUI N00bs
      - Soft Skills / Time management on a group project
      - Github / Subversion control
    - ■■Political Risks:
      - &quot;Are there political forces that can get in the way and seriously affect your project?&quot;

- High-level analysis

-
  - How to deal with Technological Risks?
    - ■■&quot;Pre Optimization is the root of all evil in programming&quot; We can build prototypes and try out pieces of technology we are thinking of using
  - How to deal with Skills Risk?
    - ■■GUI training
    - ■■Maintaining code that is readable and Refactoring
    - ■■Comments and communication is key

- Baseline architecture
  - Object Oriented Programming ([https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html))
  - Checks OS, Loads Config files / Makes config file
  - Opens or asks for desktop directory
- Plan for construction



**Construction** :

_&quot;Scrum, the most popular agile framework in_ **software development** _, is an iterative approach that has at its core the_ **sprint** _— the scrum term for iteration. Scrum teams use inspection throughout an agile project to ensure that the team meets the goals of each part of the process.&quot;_

Sprints every 2 weeks:

**Sprint 1:**

**        CMD line working program**

- Supports and handles multiple OS&#39;s
- Saves file usage in dictionary, Can save path to file + usage in hashmap
- Graveyard

**Sprint 2:**

**        GUI Phase 1:**

- Plum together Cmd program to Filebrowser GUI

**Sprint 3:**

**        GUI Phase 2 &amp; Layouts Phase 1:**

- Icon resizing based on saved usage + some form of graphical layout

**Sprint 4:**

**        Layouts Phase 2:**

- Implementing better and more visual layouts

**Sprint 5:**

**        Layouts Phase 3:**

- Improving layouts

**Transition** :

- Beta Testing
- Performance tuning
- User training
