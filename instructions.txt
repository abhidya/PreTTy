Welcome to PreTTy 1.0!

This program allows you to visualize your files in a more effective way by sizing the file icon based on how often the file is opened. 
The more you use a file, the bigger it becomes.

To change directories, either make your way into them from the starting directory or reset your config to false. 
We understand this can be very annoying to do, so in a future update, we will improve this.

Shortcuts:

<CTRL_f> = view files
<CTRL_w> = quit program
<CTRL_h> = help window
<CTRL_g> = view graveyard

Buttons:
File view  |  Home  |  File Pattern  |  Back  |  Graveyard  |  Theme Toggle  | Help

The file view provides a static representation of all of the displayed files.

The graveyard feature provides names of files that the user has not opened in 6 months. While the program will not change those files, it is a suggestion of what to delete.

To open or close a window, click the button associated with that window.
